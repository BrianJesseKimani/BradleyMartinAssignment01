=======================================

Changes to Header & Headings
-----------------

Decreased font size to make the heading more porportional to the other text on the screen. 

Added a white border around the top, right and left of the header in order to help frame it with the navigation bar.

Changed the background color of the header in order to brighten or liven the webpage as the dark, heavy background image along with the dark colored header and navgiation bar made the page seem daunting.

Changed the sub-headings of the major sections to the color of the header background in order to create a complete color scheme

Changes to Navigation Bar
--------------------------

Changed the color to the nav bar in order to create a color scheme that stand out to the user and make the nav bar easily identifyable. 

Added a hover highlight in the same color as the background iamage of page in order to integrate with the previous design.

Smooth Scrolling & Navigation
------------------------------

While the single block layout was kept, the main body of text for the website was centered into single box frame. This was chosen in order to try make the amount of wording in the webpage seem less daunting.

This box was also widened and lengthend inorder to fit images completely, as soon as the user navigated to that seciton.

The navigation was adjusted so that once a link to section in the webpage was clicked, it started with the subheading of that seciton in the box. Before, parts of the previous section would be seen. This was choosen as to create separation and for a cleaner look to the webpage.

Image Placement
----------------

Images were moved so that once naviagted to that seciton, an image would be the first thing the user sees. Again this was chosen to try to ease the user into the rest of the information within that section.
