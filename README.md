# Assignment 07 - Typography


> website - http://jbkimani.digitalscholar.rochester.edu/assignment07/

- **Old fonts**
    - Bebas Nueue, cursive (for headings)
    - Barlow-condensed, sans-serif (for paragraphs)

- **New fonts**
    - Montserrat, sans-serif for headings
    - Roboto Slabs, serif for paragraph text

### Choice Reasoning

- In assesing the content and feel of the website before my chnages i understood the page to be informational, one that aims to provide insight about the city of Syracuse, almost like a wikipedia page. Given this, I felt that as a reader the words are to tightly squeezed in together and the legibility of the paragraph typeface is not very appealing for long blocks of text. The Barlow-condensed typeface also meant that the info was not very readable because like the name suggests, the text is very condensed. 
- For these reasons, i opted to go for a tpyeface pair that borrow from different categories of typography. 
the Montserrat typeface has a geometric sans feel to it which is said to be ideal for being objective, maintaining clarity and giving a website a modern feel while the Roboto Slabs typeface is kind of Old Style giving a classic and traditional reading experience. 
- Both of the typefaces are much more legible when compared with the previous fonts and they are more readable as they have better kerning and weight to their fonts.  

### CSS changes

- Changed the font pair to give a modern yet classic reader experience as described above.
- changed the line height to 1.75em to improve the readability of the paragaphs by spacing out the text
- increased the padding from 20px to 50px to improve the margins of the text and make it more visually appealing given that large texts close up together are usually a turn off for readers.
